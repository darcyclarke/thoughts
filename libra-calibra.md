# Libra & Calibra

So, I've read a lot about Facebook's new "cryptocurrency" & wanted to consolidate some of my thoughts/thinking here. For reference, I've added some of the articles I found most useful, along with the [marketing][1] & [white paper][2] citations, [below](#references--citations).

## Introduction & Overview
At a high level, I've been extremely skeptical about the practical usage of traditional cryptocurrencies (ie. Bitcoin, Litecoin, Etherium etc.) as the fundamental technical underpinning does not scale (

### Key concepts:
- cryptography
- permission
- consensus
- wallet
- decentralized vs. centralized

## What Libra is?
- It's similar to transferring cash into PayPal or some kind of freemium game currency (ie. digital "bits")
- Using a lot of buzzwords
- Isn't decentralized (permissioned)

## What Libra isn't?
- a "traditional" cryptocurrency

## Why is it set up like this?

## Pros:
- reach
- fees
- performance (ie. sharding/forking/permission-based, 1000 transactions a second)

Cons:
- centralized banking (ie. permissioned currency which makes the "association" operate like a central bank)
- limited consensus
- restrictive association requirements (ie. a validator/regulator node on the system)
  - "To join the association, members must have a half rack of server space, a 100Mbps or above dedicated internet connection, a full-time site reliability engineer and enterprise-grade security. Businesses must hit two of three thresholds of a $1 billion USD market value or $500 million in customer balances, reach 20 million people a year and/or be recognized as a top 100 industry leader by a group like Interbrand Global or the S&P."
  - "Crypto-focused investors must have more than $1 billion in assets under management, while Blockchain businesses must have been in business for a year, have enterprise-grade security and privacy and custody or staking greater than $100 million in assets. And only up to one-third of founding members can by crypto-related businesses or individually invited exceptions. Facebook also accepts research organizations like universities, and nonprofits fulfilling three of four qualities, including working on financial inclusion for more than five years, multi-national reach to lots of users, a top 100 designation by Charity Navigator or something like it and/or $50 million in budget."
- privacy? (ie. sudo-nonymous profiles/wallets, meta data is fully visible)
- fiat-backed currency/reserve/hedge-fund(TM) (regulated by the "association"/oligarchy, 1-to-1 cash in & cash out, infinite Libra in circulation)
- interest/value isn't dictated by market fluctuations or demand (regulated by the "association"/oligarchy)
  - any interest on fiat currency put into the system is distributed relatively between regulators (ie. consider the exchange of cash for Libra as if you were putting money into a traditional savings account which the bank redistributes or gains interest on)
- "Calibra" is a managed wallet; ie. you have safety/support for backups to any hack/loss but don't actually "own" your Lbra (ie. this will face similar problems/hurdles to PayPal accounts)
- No accountability/regulation at the transaction level
  - Wallet/application developers are not vetted
  - Transactions are all irreversible  (although, all blockchain cryptocurrencies are like this, it's just a very dangerous precedent to be setting on-mass)
- Will probably never be recognized by the institutional banks/governments (ie. you can't pay your taxes or mortgage with Libra)

## Will it be "successful" & is it "good"?
- This will be determined by the adoption/support amongst the wider marketplace (ex. similar to Apple/Android pay systems)
- It will almost assuradly take over some marketshare from existing payment processors (ie. Apple/Android/PayPal/Stripe/Interac)
