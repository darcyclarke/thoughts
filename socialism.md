# Socialism

I've historically been a "left-leaning" individual. Here in Canada I've only ever voted for the NDP (New Democratic Party) & the Liberals in my lifetime. That said, I do possess conservative views & find much more nuance in the world then could ever put me into a single category or political party. I especially hate the labels "right" & "left". Like, where's the center?

That said, I've begun thinking more & more critically about western economies; particularly Canada (because that's where I live). In some respects, I believe Canada's struggles are representative of the wider trend we see in the neighbouring U.S. & first-world countries abroad. At the crux of these thoughts, I believe a persistent shift "left" in these countries has actually become problematic. At its core, governments grow too large, are expected to provide too much & become ineffecient/ineffective. This seems inevitable & primarily stems from a lack of guardrails to prevent the growth of the government itself & its spending. Governments aren't like businesses & elected officials often need little in the way of serious qualifications to make generational, life-altering decisions on the behalf of others. Because government's primary function is to extract & redistribute taxes, in peacful times, there is no incentive for the goverment to make popular or trustworthy decisions on constituents behalf (other then politicians own self preservation - which is sort of a race to the bottom). There are little-to-no checks & balances to ensure elected officials are held accountable for their decisions. Misappropriation & populism seem ranpent yet inevitable & there seems to be nothing more popular then socialist ideologies (ie. obtaining something for nothing).

Record productivity lows in Canada, stagnating investment/innovation, record debt & a government budget/spending which accounts for more then >51% our GDP make me think we've hit a dangerous tipping point. Here's why:

### The Dangers of Becoming Socialist as a Society

1. **Economic Inefficiency and Resource Misallocation**
  - **Central Planning Challenges:** Socialist economies often rely on central planning, which struggles to manage complex economies efficiently. The inability to respond to supply and demand leads to shortages, surpluses, and misallocation of resources, as seen in historical examples like the Soviet Union and Venezuela.
  - **Lack of Market Incentives:** Socialism tends to reduce the profit motive, which drives innovation and productivity in market economies. When individuals and companies lack financial incentives, economic stagnation often follows.
2. **Erosion of Individual Freedom**
  - **Government Overreach:** In socialist systems, the state often assumes control of major industries and resources, concentrating power in the government. This centralization can suppress individual freedoms and choices, as the government dictates many aspects of life.
  - **Historical Examples:** Countries that implemented socialism often devolved into authoritarian regimes (e.g., North Korea, Cuba), where dissent is suppressed to maintain the socialist structure.
3. **Economic Stagnation and Poverty**
  - **Redistribution Effects:** Redistribution of wealth can demotivate high earners and entrepreneurs, reducing overall economic output and innovation. The lack of competition can lead to stagnation.
  - **Historical Outcomes:** Countries like Venezuela, which transitioned to socialist policies, experienced economic collapse, hyperinflation, and widespread poverty despite abundant natural resources.
4. **Dependency and Loss of Personal Responsibility**
	- **Welfare Dependency:** Extensive social welfare systems can create dependency, discouraging self-reliance and reducing the workforce participation rate.
	- **Moral Hazard:** People may take fewer risks or work less when basic needs are guaranteed, reducing overall societal productivity.
5. **Unsustainability of Funding**
	- **High Tax Burdens:** Socialist policies often require heavy taxation, which can disincentivize investment and drive wealth out of the country.
	- **Debt Accumulation:** In attempting to provide universal services, governments often incur unsustainable debt, as seen in welfare-heavy states facing fiscal crises.

### Role of Social Studies in Perpetuating Non-Scientific Insights

I believe social studies/sciences play a significant role in the decline of productivity in the western economies as more & more students opt for these kinds of degrees with little-to-no practical application of that education outside academia (which seems like a regressive career path). The following are some thoughts as to how social studies play into the economic decline I believe we're experiencing today.

1. **Reliance on Subjectivity and Ideology**
  - Social studies often prioritize qualitative research methods (e.g., interviews, ethnographies) over quantitative, data-driven approaches, leading to subjective conclusions influenced by the researcher’s biases.
  - Curricula in social studies programs may lean toward promoting specific ideologies, such as socialism or collectivism, rather than critically examining them.
2. **Funding Bias**
  - Research funding often comes from institutions or governments with ideological leanings. This creates incentives for academics to produce findings that align with their sponsors’ views, perpetuating biased narratives.
  - For example, studies funded by progressive think tanks might emphasize systemic inequality as an argument for redistribution, even if alternative models exist.
3. **Echo Chambers in Academia**
  - Academic environments in social studies are often ideologically homogenous, with limited representation of dissenting perspectives (e.g., classical liberalism, libertarianism). This lack of diversity discourages critical evaluation of prevailing theories.
  - This contributes to the perpetuation of reductive frameworks like “oppressor vs. oppressed,” ignoring economic complexity and nuance.
4. **Reductionist Frameworks**
  - Social studies often focus on identity-based or Marxist frameworks, simplifying societal problems into binaries (e.g., rich vs. poor, privileged vs. oppressed). This can lead to policies that fail to address root causes or consider unintended consequences.
  - These frameworks sometimes dismiss empirical evidence from fields like economics or psychology, favoring narratives over data.
5. **Perpetuation Through Education**
  - K-12 and university curricula increasingly incorporate social studies narratives that focus on equity over merit, redistribution over growth, and systemic blame over individual responsibility.
  - Students exposed to such narratives may adopt these views uncritically, perpetuating their influence in policy-making and societal norms.

### Conclusion

Socialism, while appealing in its promise of equality, often leads to economic inefficiency, authoritarianism, and reduced innovation, making it a dangerous societal model when fully implemented. The role of social studies in perpetuating non-scientific methods of insight contributes to this danger by prioritizing ideology over empiricism and discouraging critical evaluation of its foundational assumptions.

> Note: these thoughts are in no way supportive of a completely capitalist or liberatarian society rather just an analysis of where I believe we are & are headed if we continue the current trend. As noted before, I have nuanced opinions on all aspects of government/society & usually prefer to think about & discuss particular topics rather macro-economic trends or introduce my own subjectivity (although that's exactly what my thoughts are). This article is an anlysis emergent outcomes I'm seeing with how western governments have organized/operated over the last 30-40 years (ie. my lifetime).
